The K-means++ algorithm is used to choose initial centroids for the K-means algorithm. In
this assignment, you will implement this algorithm in Python and integrate it with the K-means
algorithm of HW1 that will be ported to a C extension using the C API.
The goals of the assignment are:
• Port your existing C code into a C extension using the C API.
• Experience the Numpy, Pandas and other external packages.
